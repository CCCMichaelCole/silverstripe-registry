summary: How to manage databases and registries using the CMS

## In this section:

* An overview of the registry CMS interface

## Before we begin
Make sure that your SilverStripe installation has the [Registry](http://addons.silverstripe.org/add-ons/silverstripe/registry) module installed.

This module provides a page type that you can use to embed Registry data in your website.

# Registry

Websites running on the Common Web Platform can publish databases, not just traditional web pages. For example, you might publish a database of all of the schools in the country, or a registry of people holding a qualification, so that website visitors can find information they seek.

The built-in features:

* a public search form
* see data summarised in a list, and drill into detail on an item by item basis.
* export to CSV (and RESTFul API)
* CMS Administrators can bulk upload data via CSV or edit items one by one using an online form

A website developer is needed initially to create the “database” however subsequently it can be readily managed and interacted with using online tools as pictured below:

Pictured above is a summary of the admin area for managing registry data.
